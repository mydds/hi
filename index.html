        Hi I’m <span class="word" data-popup-type="circle" data-popup-content="images/me3.jpg">Danny</span>. I grew up on the other side of the <span class="word" data-popup-type="circle" data-popup-content="images/indoglobe4.png" >globe</span> & have since lived, traveled, and worked in 130+ countries around the world, each of which has uniquely <span class="word" data-popup-type="text" data-popup-content="<ul><li>Social impact + innovation</li><li>Tech for emerging markets</li><li>web3 & blockchain tech</li><li>impact investing</li><li>AI / NLP</li><li>human-centered design</li><li>microfinance</li></ul>">shaped</span> my life. I have a <span class="word" data-popup-type="grid2" data-popup-content="images/fuqua.png,images/umdlogo.png,images/hkust3.png|<strong><big>Duke University (MBA)</big></strong><br>University of Maryland (BSc)<br><small><em>International Business & Finance</em></small>">business</span> background, but my work has spanned some pretty wide-ranging areas — I've led operations for global humanitarian responses, launched new business ventures in emerging markets, and built tech platforms to connect international teams across every continent ..among other <a href='http://www.linkedin.com' target='_blank'><span class="word" data-popup-type="text" data-popup-content="across international operations, innovation, strategy, program management / special projects, business development, bus ops & finance..">things</span></a>. 
        After over a decade leading various business + development initiatives, I began a personal <span class="word" data-popup-type="grid" data-popup-content="images/Project1.jpg, images/Project2.jpg, images/Project3.jpg, images/Project4.jpg, images/Project5.jpg, images/Project6.jpg, images/Project7.jpg, images/Project8.jpg, images/Project9.jpg">project</span> around the world, with a simple goal to leave each community I met along the way just a little bit better. The reality of this journey blew away even my wildest expectations — from working with tribes in the mountains of <span class="word" data-popup-type="image" data-popup-content="images/TribeGroup.jpg">Ethiopia</span>, to sustainability initiatives in <span class="word" data-popup-type="image" data-popup-content="images/VanuatuTree2.jpg">Vanuatu</span>, to social entrepreneurship projects in <span class="word" data-popup-type="image" data-popup-content="images/IndoWave.jpg">Indonesia</span> it was filled with some of the most meaningful experiences of my life. It also showed me the power of technology to create opportunities in even the most remote parts of the world, and inspired me to explore these possibilities even <span class="word" data-popup-type="text" data-popup-content="<a href='http://www.explainlikeim.com'>Explain Like I'm</a> - difficult terms in plain language<br><a href='http://www.fortheworld.xyz'>For The World</a> - how new tech can help everyone">further</span>.
        Along the way I've been doing some consulting, some development, and some startup advising+investing – while on the side I’m also building some experimental <span class="static" data-popup-type="text" data-popup-content="<a href='http://www.explainlikeim.com' target='_blank'>Explain Like I'm</a> - Tech made easy<br><a href='http://www.fortheworld.xyz' target='_blank'>For The World</a> - real world use-cases for emerging tech">projects</span> to simplify emerging tech for wider communities. Outside of work I’ve held a lifelong love of <span class="word" data-popup-type="gridabove" data-popup-content="images/Exploration1.jpg, images/Exploration2.jpg, images/Exploration3.jpg, images/Exploration4.jpg, images/Exploration5.jpg, images/Exploration6.jpg, images/Exploration7.jpg, images/Exploration8.jpg, images/Exploration9.jpg ">exploration</span> and <span class="word" data-popup-type="gridabove" data-popup-content="images/Photography1.jpg, images/Photography2.jpg, images/Photography3.jpg, images/Photography4.jpg, images/Photography5.jpg, images/Photography6.jpg, images/Photography7.jpg, images/Photography8.jpg, images/Photography9.jpg">photography</span>, which I try to capture + share as much as possible. I always like meeting people who are doing things against the grain, particularly in pursuit of big, crazy dreams — if you're struggling, need some help, or just want to chat over some new ideas don't hesitate to <a href='mailto:majynd@gmail.com' target='_blank'><span class="word" data-popup-type="word" data-popup-content="email me here">reach out</span></a> and say hello.
